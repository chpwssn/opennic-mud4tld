MUD4TLD Legacy v0.71

I do not expect many more versions of this beyond small bug fixes. This version is self-contained and is designed to be used by itself, not for use with external help or third-party systems.

All versions of MUD4TLD from now on will be based upon a registrar-based system using the Remote Management API which will use it's own database, and allows the user system to be run however the operator wishes to run it.

If all you want to do is run a simple top level domain system without necessarily being a part of OpenNIC or allowing remote registrations from registrars and/or DNS providers, then use this. Otherwse, use MUD4TLD v0.80 or higher.
