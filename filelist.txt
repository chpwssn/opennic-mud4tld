File list and descriptions.

All files are under the BSL v1.0 unless otherwise specified.

Zone Initialiser:
init_tld.c - This creates the zone file. Execute with ./init_tld TLD host email IP1 IP2 > tld.zone, eg: ./init_tld oz myhost.opennic.oz hostmaster@opennic.oz 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2> oz.zone. Extracts the necessary information from the TLD database, generates a serial number and outputs this information to the screen. A redirection places it into the right file. This will be updated soon to write the zone file directly.

WHOIS Server:
wit_server.c - WIT Stands for "Who Is This", my take on another purportedly funny way to say "whois". Run as root. Needs to be run from the same directory as the domain database. This is being worked on. A script will later on make a copy of the DB and it will read from that. The copy will be made say, every 5 minutes, or whenever a domain change has been signalled.

TLD Manager:
check.php - Checks to see if a domain already exists. Forwards control to register.php.
conf.php - This holds everything together. This contains all utility functions, all sqlite routines and dresses up the header.
confirm.php - An anti-spam attempt. This confirms a user account.
domain.php - This contains nearly all domain actions. Domain detail updates as well as domain deletion is here.
index.php - Do whatever you want with this, I don't care. Just shows an example of how to provide a dynamic homepage for a TLD.
process.php - Processes the domain registration. Will soon be merged into domain.php. You arrive here from register.php.
register.php - Performs the actual recording of the new domain. Will soon be merged into domain.php. You arrive here from check.php.
user.php - Performs ALL user actions. Registration, Login, Logout and Updating of details, as well as all forms for these. Also generates the dashboard.
