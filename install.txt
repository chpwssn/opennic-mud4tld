Installation of MUD4TLD

NOTE: You will need a C compiler installed. Any Unix/Linux should already have one, so you should be good to go. You will also need SQLite3 installed, as well as the library and header files. This is essential.

The Interface:

[1] By whatever method applies to your Linux distribution or FreeBSD, install a web server with PHP support if you have not already done so. I recommend lighttpd with PHP5, but it is up to you.

[2] At the command line (change the uppercase TLD to your specified TLD below):

sqlite3 TLD_tld.sq3 < OZ_tld.sql

[3] Copy TLD_tld.sq3 to where the PHP files are. Make sure all files are read-write capable and owner and group are whatever the web server software/daemon is running under. You might also want to ensure that group read-write is set on the DB, otherwise you will get errors.

[4] Access index.php with your browser and it should all be set. Change your TLD in conf.php to make it apply throughout your site. Adjust and change the rest as necessary.


The WHOIS server:

[1] At the command line,

gcc -o wit_server wit_server.c -lsqlite3

[2] Make sure a copy of the above DB is in the same directory. Now, as root run

wit_server &

The WHOIS server is now running.


Initialise the TLD/Generate the ZONE file.

[1] Instructions are in filelist.txt, but will be transferred and expanded on here. For now, these rush instructions should do.

I recommend a CRON job script to copy the site DB to where the WHOIS server can see it, probably every little while, so domain changes can be seen. A CRON job script to re-initialise the TLD will be supplied shortly.
