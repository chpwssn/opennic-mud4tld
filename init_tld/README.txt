init_tld so far will only work properly if a domain is using an already 
established DNS provider such as a third-party DNS service or a webhost. 
It does not yet properly support custom nameservers. Please be aware of 
this.

That and it has not been exhaustively tested, so please do not use in a 
production environment just yet.
